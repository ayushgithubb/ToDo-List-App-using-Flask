## FlaskTask: Streamlined Task Manager App created using Flask in Python along with HTML

Created using Flask in Python and HTML files and has the following components:

1. Flask framework: Flask is a popular web framework used to build web applications in Python. It is used to create the web application and handle HTTP requests and responses.

2. HTML templates: HTML templates are used to render the user interface of the ToDo App. Flask uses Jinja2 templating engine to render the templates.

3. SQLite database: SQLite is a lightweight database management system used to store the ToDo list data.

Here are the steps to create a basic ToDo App using Flask:

  1.  Install Flask and SQLite
  2.  Create a Flask app object and import necessary libraries
  3.  Create a database connection and create a table to store ToDo list items
  4.  Define the routes for the ToDo app
  5.  Define the home page route to retrieve ToDo list items from the database and render the HTML template
  6.  Define the route to add a new task to the database and redirect to the home page
  7.  Define the route to delete a task from the database and redirect to the home page
  8.  Create HTML templates to render the user interface of the ToDo app:
  9.  Create an index.html file to display the ToDo list items and a form to add a new task
  10. Use Jinja2 templating engine to display the dynamic content in the HTML template
  11. Run the Flask app and test the app by adding and deleting tasks.
